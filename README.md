# quixl
A pixel art maker written in python.

### Why did I name it quixl?
I forgot pixel had an 'e' in it so I thought qui(ck-pi)xl
but I like the name so I'm not changing it.

## To run quixl:
pygame and Pillow are required  
Then, just run **main.py**

## How to Draw
Pixel art is simple with quixl!  
> **Left click** to draw  
> **Right click** to erase  
> **Middle click** to select color  

## File saving and loading
Files will be saved and loaded from the quixl.png file.
File names are a planned feature.

## Colors:
We have 4 sliders. R, G, B, Grayscale.
The first 3 are self-explanatory, for selecting RGB colors.
The grayscale slider will control R, G, and B at the same time for easy selection of blacks, whites, and grays.
